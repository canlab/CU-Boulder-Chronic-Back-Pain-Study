The CU Boulder Chronic Back Pain study is currently enrolling!
If you are aged 21 - 70 and have had back pain for the past 3 or more months, you may be eligible.  Read on!

## Background
Recent research has revolutionized our understanding of chronic pain.  It suggests that the brain plays a central role in chronic pain.  However, the brain correlates of chronic pain remain unclear, and how to leverage this new perpsective on chronic pain to develop better treatments is an open question.

## Research aims
This study has two goals.  First, we aim to identify the brain bases of chronic back pain.  Second, we aim to test the efficacy of a brain-based psychological treatment for chronic back pain.  The treatment is safe, and does not involve any pharmaceuticals or surgical interventions.  Instead, it aims to leverage the natural power of the brain to treat chronic back pain.

## Participation overview
The study will take about 8 weeks.  It requires two functional MRI brain scans -- one before and one after treatment.  These brain scans are safe, painless, and noninvasive.

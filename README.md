If you are aged 21 - 70 and have had back pain for the past 3 or more months, you may be eligible.

## Background
Recent research has dramatically changed our understanding of chronic pain.  It has suggested that the brain plays a central role in chronic pain.

## Research Aims
This study has two goals.  First, we aim to advance our scientific understanding of the brain bases of chronic back pain.  Second, we aim to test a brain-based psychological treatment for chronic back pain.  The treatment is safe; it does not involve any pharmaceuticals or surgeries.  Instead, it aims to leverage the brain's plasticitiy to treat chronic back pain.

## Participation Overview
The study will take about 8 weeks.  It requires two functional MRI brain scans -- one before and one after treatment.  These brain scans are safe, painless, and noninvasive.  We will also ask you to complete a number of questionnaires.  More details about the study are linked to below.

If you are aged 21 - 70 and have had back pain for the past 3 or more months, you may be eligible.  Read on!

## Background
Recent research has dramatically changed our understanding of chronic pain.  It has suggested that the brain plays a central role in chronic pain.

## Research Aims
This study has two goals.  First, we aim to advance our scientific understanding of the **brain bases of chronic back pain**.  Second, we aim to test a **mind-body treatment** for chronic back pain.

## Participation Overview
The study will take about 8 weeks.  It requires two functional MRI brain scans -- one before and one after treatment.  The brain scans are safe and noninvasive (no radioactivity, no contrast agents).  We will also ask you to complete a number of questionnaires. You will be compensated ~$200 for your time.
